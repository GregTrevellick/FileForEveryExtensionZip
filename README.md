# Files For Every Extension

A collection of 35,126 tiny (11 bytes) files, each with a unique extension, such as xxx.AAA, xxx.AAB, xxx.AAC through to xxx.ZZZ.

Files are broken down into separate folders per letter of the alphabet. Each folder therefore contains 1,351 files. 

Files created courtesy of [Files For Every Extension Creator](https://github.com/GregTrevellick/FilesForEveryExtensionCreator).

## Features

An unexpected by-product is the GitHub linguist intepretation of the different programming languages used by the thousands of files.
