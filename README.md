# Files For Every Extension

[![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/gittools/gitlink.svg)](https://github.com/GregTrevellick/FilesForEveryExtension/blob/master/LICENCE.md)

A collection of 35,126 tiny (11 bytes) files, each with a unique extension, such as xxx.AAA, xxx.AAB, xxx.AAC through to xxx.ZZZ.

Also includes files ending with an 'X' extension i.e. xxx.DOC plus xxx.DOCX.

Files are broken down into separate folders per letter of the alphabet. Each folder therefore contains 1,351 files.

Files created using [Files For Every Extension Creator](https://github.com/GregTrevellick/FilesForEveryExtensionCreator).

## Features

An unexpected by-product is the interesting GitHub linguist interpretation of the different programming languages used by the thousands of files.
